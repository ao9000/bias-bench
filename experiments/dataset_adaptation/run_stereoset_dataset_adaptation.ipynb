    "Singapore is a religiously diverse country. With Buddhism (31.1%), Christianity (18.9%), Islam (15.6%), Taoism (8.8%), and Hinduism (5.0%) being the major religions. \n",
    "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights and trends for Singapore:\n",
    "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
    "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
    "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
    "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",

    "Key gender insights and trends for Singapore:\n",
    "1. Significant increase in educational attainment for females: Women with at least a diploma qualification rose from 36% in 2002 to 71% in 2018.\n",

    "4. Gender pay gap factors: Possible factors include unmeasured employment characteristics, caregiving responsibilities, parenthood, and potential labour market discrimination.\n",
    "5. Gender occupational segregation: Women are over-represented in traditionally lower-paying occupations (e.g., nursing, teaching, administrative roles) while men dominate higher-paying roles (e.g., medical doctors, ICT professionals).\n",
    "6. Occupational segregation factors: Possible factors include gender differences in personality traits, skills, psychological traits, value placed on workplace flexibility, and social norms in gender roles within families.\n",
    "7. University graduates by gender: Business and Administration remained the most common field for both genders, but was more prevalent among female graduates (39.0%) compared to males (31.2%) in 2020. Engineering Sciences remained male-dominated (27.2% of male graduates vs 7.4% of female graduates). Humanities & Social Sciences had a higher proportion of female graduates (14.9%) compared to males (8.2%).\n",
    "8. Fertility Trends: More highly educated women tended to have fewer children on average. The average number of children born to ever-married women aged 40-49 decreased from 2.02 in 2010 to 1.76 in 2020.\n",
    "9. Marital status trends: For university graduates aged 40-49, singlehood was more common among females (18.7%) than males (12.3%). Among those aged 30-39, singlehood was more common for males (35.4%) than females (29.9%) in 2020.\n",

      "You are a helpful AI assistant for adapting the StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from the context of the United States (USA) to the context of Singaporean (SG). StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",

      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",

      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "You are a helpful AI assistant for adapting the StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from the context of the United States (USA) to the context of Singaporean (SG). StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",

      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",

      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "You are a helpful AI assistant for adapting the StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from the context of the United States (USA) to the context of Singaporean (SG). StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each StereoSet sample contains:\n",
      "target: The group or individual that is the subject of potential stereotyping.\n",
      "bias_type: Categorizes the type of bias expressed in the sentences. It can be one of the 3 categories: race, gender or religion.\n",

      "Singapore is a religiously diverse country. With Buddhism (31.1%), Christianity (18.9%), Islam (15.6%), Taoism (8.8%), and Hinduism (5.0%) being the major religions. \n",
      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "You are a helpful AI assistant for adapting the StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from the context of the United States (USA) to the context of Singaporean (SG). StereoSet is a dataset that measures stereotypical biases in pre-trained language models (LLMs). StereoSet focuses on three domains: gender, race, and religion. Each sample in StereoSet presents three sentence completions: a stereotypical option, an anti-stereotypical option, and an unrelated (meaningless) option. Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context. You do not need to provide any explanations or justifications for your completions. Your task is to adapt the context and sentences to the Singaporean context.\n",

      "Between 2010 and 2020, there were several key religion insights for Singapore:\n",
      "1. Increasing secularization: The proportion of residents with no religious affiliation rose from 17.0% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2020. This trend was observed across all age groups and education levels.\n",
      "2. Decline in traditional Chinese religions: The percentages of Buddhists and Taoists decreased slightly over the decade. Buddhism fell from 33.3% to 31.1%, while Taoism dropped from 10.9% to 8.8%.\n",
      "3. Slight increases in Christianity and Islam: The shares of Christians and Muslims saw small increases. Christianity grew from 18.3% to 18.9%, and Islam from 14.7% to 15.6%.\n",
      "4. Age-related differences: Younger residents were more likely to report no religious affiliation compared to older residents. In 2020, 24.2% of those aged 15-24 had no religion, compared to 15.2% of those 55 and older.\n",
      "5. Generational shifts: Buddhism and Taoism were more prevalent among older residents, while Islam was more common among younger residents. Christianity remained relatively evenly distributed across age groups.\n",
      "6. Educational correlation: Those with higher educational qualifications were more likely to have no religious affiliation. In 2020, 27.8% of university graduates reported no religion, compared to 11.6% of those with below secondary education.\n",
      "7. Ethnic variations: Among the Chinese, Buddhists remained the largest group at 40.4% in 2020, despite decreasing from 43.0% in 2010. The proportion of Taoists similarly decreased, while those with no religion increased the most (from 21.8% to 25.7%), followed by Christians. In contrast, the Malay population remained overwhelmingly Muslim (98.8%), and the Indian population maintained a Hindu majority (57.3%) with slight increases in other religions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

    "3. Education Profile: Indians saw the highest University degree attainment rate in 2020 at 41.3%, followed by Chinese at 34.7% and Malays at 10.8%. While on the other hand, the Malays had the highest proportion of residents with below secondary education at 28.9%, followed by Chinese at 26.2% and Indians at 18.3%.\n",

This was followed by Chinese residents, with 79.6% literacy in Chinese, and Indian residents, with 45.0% literacy in Tamil. Notably, Indian residents also exhibited significant proficiency in other languages, including Malay and Hindi.\n",

Remember that there must be one stereotype, one anti-stereotype, and one unrelated sentence completion for each context.\n",
